# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Houssam Al Halabi, a Junior Web Developer and IT Specialist. Holder for a bachelor's degree in Information Technology, and am currently pursuing postgraduate studies in management as a Master of Business Administration student.

👨‍💻 I recently completed an 8-month apprenticeship training program in Full-Stack Development at "Codi Bootcamp". As a result, I'm now a certified Web Developer!

🎭 In my spare time, I enjoy challenging myself to learn new skills. My interests range from making memes, playing video games, watching football games, and having fun with friends to more unusual ones like creating new recipes because I'm always willing to try new things.

⚛️ That's why I'm so enthusiastic about cutting-edge technologies like Metaverse, Edge Computing, Quantum Computing, and Virtual Reality.
